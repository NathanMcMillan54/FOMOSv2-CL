//! ## Kernel interfaces
//!
//! Both `arch` and `bsp` contain code that is conditionally compiled depending on the actual target
//! and board for which the kernel is compiled. For example, the `interrupt controller` hardware of
//! the `Raspberry Pi 3` and the `Raspberry Pi 4` is different, but we want the rest of the `kernel`
//! code to play nicely with any of the two without much hassle.
//!
//! In order to provide a clean abstraction between `arch`, `bsp` and `generic kernel code`,
//! `interface` traits are provided *whenever possible* and *where it makes sense*. They are defined
//! in the respective subsystem module and help to enforce the idiom of *program to an interface,
//! not an implementation*. For example, there will be a common IRQ handling interface which the two
//! different interrupt controller `drivers` of both Raspberrys will implement, and only export the
//! interface to the rest of the `kernel`.
//!
//! ```

//! # Summary
//!
//! For a logical `kernel` subsystem, corresponding code can be distributed over several physical
//! locations. Here is an example for the **memory** subsystem:
//!
//! - `src/memory.rs` and `src/memory/**/*`
//!   - Common code that is agnostic of target processor architecture and `BSP` characteristics.
//!     - Example: A function to zero a chunk of memory.
//!   - Interfaces for the memory subsystem that are implemented by `arch` or `BSP` code.
//!     - Example: An `MMU` interface that defines `MMU` function prototypes.
//! - `src/bsp/__board_name__/memory.rs` and `src/bsp/__board_name__/memory/**/*`
//!   - `BSP` specific code.
//!   - Example: The board's memory map (physical addresses of DRAM and MMIO devices).
//! - `src/_arch/__arch_name__/memory.rs` and `src/_arch/__arch_name__/memory/**/*`
//!   - Processor architecture specific code.
//!   - Example: Implementation of the `MMU` interface for the `__arch_name__` processor
//!     architecture.
//!
//! From a namespace perspective, **memory** subsystem code lives in:
//!
//! - `crate::memory::*`
//! - `crate::bsp::memory::*`
