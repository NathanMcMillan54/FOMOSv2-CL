When writing new Rust macros for FOMOSv2-CL, like most files you need to write certain things in a comment at the top of
the file. You will need:
    - File name
    - Your name or user name
    - Short description

Read editing/files.txt for more information about adding your files to FOMOSv2-CL.

Macro example:
/* my_macro.rs
 * Macro by my name or git user name
 *
 * Description:
 * This is my macro.
 * */
