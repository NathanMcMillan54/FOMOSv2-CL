If you have added your own files to FOMOSv2-CL and make a pull request your added files need to have the following at
the top of the file:
    - File name
    - How to build/compile
    - Short description of what it does

This makes it easier for anyone looking at the file to get an idea of what your new file does. While writing the
description, try to explain it the best you can and keep it as short as possible. If you are writing Rust
macros read editing/macros.txt to see how you can have your macro file added to FOMOSv2-CL.

File example:
/* myFileName
 *
 * Build/compile:
 * compile myFileName
 *
 * Description:
 * This is my file
 * */
