Build Linux kernel for arm:

sh build_LinuxArm.sh

Build Linux kernel for x86:

sh build_LinuxX86.sh

Running these commands will take a long time no matter how powerful your computer is. After the Linux Kernel has been
built you need to compile FOMOSv2-CL. Run:

sh build_FOMOSv2-CL.sh

This shouldn't take as long as it did while compiling Linux.
