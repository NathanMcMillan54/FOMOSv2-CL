If you are a developer and want to edit/simulate FOMOS you'll have to start by following the same instructions the user does.
Run:
        sh install.sh
        sh build.sh

After you run those files you need to run another file to simulate FOMOS.
Run:
        sh run.sh

In run.sh it tells qemu what CPU brand and type to use.
