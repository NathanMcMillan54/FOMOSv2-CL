When you compile a Rust file with Cargo a directory called target/ will be made with all the compiled Rust files in it.

FOMOS is made almost entirely with Rust so compiled files will go into target/. If you run build.sh it compiles FOMOS and
makes target/ with all compiled files. When you run run.sh to simulate FOMOS it says to go into
target/aarch64-unknown-none/debug/ and then runs file FOMSOv2-CL. FOMOSv2-CL file runs src/start.s then start.s runs src/main.rs
etc...

So don't delete anything in target/ then put FOMOS on a device. If you're going to change something in there then delete
the entire directory.
