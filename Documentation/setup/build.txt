To compile FOMOSv2-CL run build.sh, when you run build.sh you need to give it an argument which would be the CPU you're
compiling FOMOSv2-CL for.

    sh build.sh <x86, armv6, armv7>

This will compile FOMOSv2-CL and link it to a file that the Linux Kernel will run, the compiled file is named init which
can run this without Qemu if you compiled for the CPU your device has. Read Documentation/Setup/running.txt
