If you compiled FOMOSv2-CL for the same CPU your device has, you can run the compiled file (init) as a normal executable
file. If you want to run init on an unsupported CPU you could try to run it in the Linux kernel with Qemu,
Documentation/kernel/linux.txt talks about compiling the Linux kernel and linking FOMOSv2-CL to it. To run FOMOSv2-CL if
you compiled it for your device's CPU just run:

    ./init

To run FOMOSv2-CL properly, run FOMOSv2-CL_v2_3_5.cpio.gz as an initramf/initrd in the Linux kernel (version v5.x). Or
you could clone the FOMOS_installer from https://github.com/sbFomos/FOMOS_installer/, read the README for instructions
for compiling FOMOS and Linux.
