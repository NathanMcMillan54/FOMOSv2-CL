If you compiled FOMOSv2-CL for the same CPU your device has, you can run the compiled file (init) as a normal executable
file. If you want to run init on an unsupported CPU you could try to run it in the Linux kernel with Qemu,
Documentation/kernel/linux.txt talks about compiling the Linux kernel and linking FOMOSv2-CL to it. To run FOMOSv2-CL if
you compiled it for your device's CPU just run:

    ./init
