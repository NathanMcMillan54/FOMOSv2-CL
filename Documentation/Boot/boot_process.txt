If you compiled all of FOMOS by running build.sh there will be a file added to boot/ called kernel.img which is a compiled file that came from kernel.s.

kernel.img:
    kernel.img is an image file that the bootloader will look for, when it finds kernel.img it will do everything it says
    to do (everything in kernel.s).

kernel.s:
    kernel.s runs boot/FOMOS.c. Assembly is nothing but characters and numbers everywhere, so kernel.s runs FOMOS.c because
    C uses proper words and is easier to understand.

FOMSO.c:
    FOMOS.c runs on startup after kernel.s has called it. If you want FOMOS to do something on startup put it in this file.
    FOMOS.c will start src/main.rs which is actually FOMOS.
