This will explain the booting process of FOMOS on diffrent CPUs.

ARM:
The ARM boot directory can be found in src/. In arch/arm/ there should be a image file that will be made after building
FOMOS, that will run ARM FOMOS on startup. That image file should run src/boot/arm-booot.s which runs src/main.rs which
runs FOMOS.

x86:
There is no boot for x86 yet.
