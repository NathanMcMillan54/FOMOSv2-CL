If you compiled all of FOMOS by running build.sh there will be a file added to the top directory called kernel.img which is a compiled file that came from src/boot/kernel.s.

kernel.img:
    kernel.img is an image file that the bootloader will look for, when it finds kernel.img it will do everything it says
    to do (everything in src/boot/kernel.s).

kernel.s:
    kernel.s runs src/main.rs. Assembly is nothing but characters and numbers everywhere, so kernel.s runs main.rs because
    Rust uses proper words and is easier to understand.

main.rs:
    main.rs runs on startup after kernel.s has called it. If you want FOMOS to do something on startup put it in
    boot/boot.rs.
