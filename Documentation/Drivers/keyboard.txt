In directory src/drivers/keyboard/ you'll find the drivers for USB keyboards.
For now it will only support US QWERTY keyboards until touch screen works for mobile devices.


The first device to support FOMOS will be an RPi, so the keyboard drivers for now will work for the RPi.


Linux testing
Run:
    make all
    ./keyboard_drivers
    echo $?

Output:
    1
