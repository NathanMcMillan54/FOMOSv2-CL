FOMOSv2-CL right now (October 2020) just prints all this:

Booting... Loading FOMOS...
Setting up FOMOS...
Setting up drivers...
keyboard.rs screen.rs


Then the terminal prints this:

CL
FOMOSv2-CL loading done
$>>

Nothing else happens, it just starts a loop that never ends. In the future FOMOS should take keyboard input for
commands, then display the output on a screen.
