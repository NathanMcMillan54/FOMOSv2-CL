# About

FOMOS stands for: Free, Open source, Mobile, Operating, System.

The first version of FOMOS is just a GUI replacement for Linux but this will be a real OS.

In version 3 of FOMOS it should be a mix of FOMOSv1-Yellow and FOMOSv2-CL (this version of FOMOS).

# Setup

Compile with GCC (GNU, Compiler, Collection) on Linux.

```commandline
cd FOMOS/
make all
make run
```

That'll compile and run FOMOS.


## TODO

- [ ] Get bootloader working
- [ ] Get everything from [FOMOSv2-CLtest](https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/FOMOSv2-CLtest) into this FOMSOv2-CL
