# About

FOMOS stands for: Free, Open source, Mobile, Operating, System.

The first version of FOMOS is just a GUI replacement for Linux but this will be a real OS.

In version 3 of FOMOS it should be a mix of FOMOSv1-Yellow and FOMOSv2-CL (this version of FOMOS).

# BIOS
This probably only works on Linux

Run this to setup the BIOS:
```shell script
make -C BIOS run
```
