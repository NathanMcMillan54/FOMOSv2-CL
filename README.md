# About

FOMOS stands for: Free, Open source, Mobile, Operating, System.

The first version of FOMOS is just a GUI replacement for Linux but this will be a real OS.

In version 3 of FOMOS it should be a mix of FOMOSv1-Yellow and FOMOSv2-CL (this version of FOMOS).

# Setup

Run
```shell script
sh compile.sh
```

## TODO

- [ ] Get boot working
- [ ] Get everything from [FOMOSv2-CLtest](https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/FOMOSv2-CLtest) into this FOMSOv2-CL
