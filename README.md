FOMOSv2-CL is the second version of FOMOS.
[FOMOSv1-Yellow](https://github.com/NathanMcMillan54/FOMOSv1-Yellow) was a GUI replacement for Ubuntu and it could be used on mobile devices.
This will be an actual operating system. The CL in FOMOSv2-CL stands for: Command Line. FOMOSv2 won't have a GUI it'll just be a terminal.
