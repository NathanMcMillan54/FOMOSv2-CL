This file is so people don't forget what anything in FOMOS is supposed to do.
On 2020/9/2 there is only one directory in FOMOS, that leads to three directories, they all lead to seven directories, they all lead to two directories.

In total that's sixteen directories so FOMOS might be very confusing to many people.

In FOMOS/ there is a file called setup.c, that sets up FOMOS after the non-existing bootloader starts FOMOS.
In FOMOS/ there is a file called main.c, that is FOMOS, after setup.c is finished it will run main.c.
In FOMOS/users/ there is a file called user.sh, that is used for login for FOMOS.
In FOMOS/include/ there are many directories that are all header files that make FOMOS work.
In FOMOS/drivers/ there are many directories that are all header files that make hardware work on FOMOS.
In FOMOS/boot it will add FOMOS to an ARM device and run FOMOS on startup.
